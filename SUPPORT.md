# Support

PsySec Group contributors have limited availability to address general support
questions. Please make sure you are using a [currently-supported version of
Node.js](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/releases).

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

* [Wiki]([https://nodejs.org/en/](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/wiki))
* [Discussions](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/discussions)
* [Issues](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+is%3Aclosed)

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, try these unofficial resources:

* [Questions tagged 'psychosecurity' on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/psychosecurity)

GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, **not general support**.
[Discussions](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/discussions/categories/general) are a better place for general support.

The open source license grants you the freedom to use psychosecurity-first principles. It does not
guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and manage your expectations.
