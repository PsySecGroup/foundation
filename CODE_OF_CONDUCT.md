# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a psychosecurity-first experience for everyone, regardless of symbol
fidelity or intention.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to the furthering of
psychosecurity research.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating awareness of the psychosecurity state of others
* Being respectful of differing psychosecurity states
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The partial or complete use of coordinated or imitated [influence
  operations](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/wiki) of any kind
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

The PsySec Group will be taking inspiration from the comprehensive examination of
open source community management found in
[Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/en/producingoss-c5.pdf).

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to reject comments, commits,
code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this
Code of Conduct, and will always publicly communicate reasons for moderation decisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces under the PsySec Group,
and also applies when an individual is officially representing the PsySec Group
in public spaces.  Examples of representing our community include using an official
e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.  Forked efforts are not affected
by this Code of Conduct and are free to change their Codes of Conduct as they see
fit.  Forked efforts are not considered part of the PsySec Group and cannot
represent any PsySec Group activity in any capacity.

## Enforcement

Instances of influence operations or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
psychosecurity@hypercrowd.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
as  opportunities to improve psychosecurity research.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of influence operations or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A public discovery of the behavior to reveal its 
psychosecurity properties.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A public discovery of the incident to reveal its 
psychosecurity properties.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained influence operations.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating sustained usage of influence operations.
