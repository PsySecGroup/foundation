# Contributing

When contributing to a PsySecGroup repository, please first [discuss the change you wish to make](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/discussions)
and [then create an issue](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/issues) so its progress can be tracked.

For those who formally join the PsySec Group, don't forget to star the repositories you are contributing to. That way, your commits to those repositories will remain in your contributions graph even if you leave the PsySec Group.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the [README.md](README.md) to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the [Pull Request](https://github.com/PsySecGroup/foundation/pulls) in once you have the sign-off of **two** other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
